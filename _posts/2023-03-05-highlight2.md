I'm fascinated with the dorkily named Human-Food Interaction (HFI). There are so many cool elements to look at, to tweak, to explore. Food ties in with creation, sharing, enjoyment, nutrition, reward... I love food and I love technology, so why not combine them?

## Why Human-Food Interaction?

### A Multimodal Interaction

One of the element I love about HFI is the multimodal nature of eating. And I love [multimodal interacitions](https://github.com/womei/Graduation/blob/master/WoMeijerGraduationReport.pdf). Exploring how sight, smell, social suggestion, haptics, and everything get blended into a change in how we perceive food is something I want to explore.

### Psychological Benefits of Food

Another thing that I love about food, is how it can have significant psychological benefits. It has the power to evoke emotions, trigger memories, and foster connections. Thus, better HFI means better food experiences, means happier and more connected people.

### HFI Beyond Eating

Cooking, too, can be a therapeutic and creative outlet, promoting well-being and mental health. By studying HFI, we can further understand and harness these psychological benefits for various purposes, including improving overall quality of life.

## My Contributions

In my journey of exploring HFI, I have already undertaken exciting projects and initiatives. Here are a few highlights:

1. **Egg 3D Printer:** With a team in Korea I developed an [egg 3D printer](https://youtu.be/ZwiE8NgI4WU), which combines technology and culinary artistry. This project showcases the intersection of food and technology, creating novel and visually stunning food designs.

2. **Food 3D Printing and Co-creation:** I am currently exploring how I can use a food 3D printer to "co-creation" food. By involving users in the design process and printing process, I aim to create customized and interactive cookong experiences that taste good and feel good to create.

3. **Medium Article on HFI in Space:** After my masters thesis, I wrote a [Medium article that outlines the case for HFI in space exploration](https://medium.com/@womeijer/extended-food-305f4b5005d3). More news on that to follow ;)

## Future Endeavors

I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of HFI next to (and hopefully during) my PhD work!

- **Research Expansion:** I will delve deeper into the realm of HFI, conducting rigorous research to explore new frontiers and address existing challenges. I aim to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in this field.

- **Publications and Sharing Knowledge:** I will actively publish my findings, insights, and discoveries to academic journals, conferences, and online platforms, ensuring that the HFI community and the broader audience can benefit from my work.

- **Collaboration and Innovation:** I am keen on collaborating with other researchers, professionals, and enthusiasts in the field to foster innovation and generate transformative ideas. By working together, we can amplify the impact of HFI and create a more connected and engaging food experience.

## Conclusion

Human-Food Interaction is a captivating area of study that encompasses multimodal interaction, psychological benefits, and lots of fun directions to explore. Through my work, including the development of unique food printers, exploring co-creation with chocolate, and advocating for HFI in space, I aim to contribute to this field and uncover new possibilities.
