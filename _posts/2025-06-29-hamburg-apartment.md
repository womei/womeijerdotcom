## Hi, my name is Wo Meijer

![Wo Meijer](https://womeijer.com/assets/images/wo_pic.jpg)
I'm 31 years old, a dual US / Dutch citizen, the lead designer at goodBytz.

And I'm looking for an apartment in Hamburg.

### What am I looking for

A clean, quite apartment:

- at least 2 rooms,
- near a metro station (U1 or U3),
- budget 1,500 euros per month (and not more than 25 euro per mÂ²).
- Starting in August or September

### Nice to haves

- close to green space
- close to grocery stores
- bigger
- cheaper ;)

### Why I am a good tenant

- I have been renting for the last 12 years
- never missed rent payment
- no debt (and clean schufa)
- steady income
- savings
- clean, respectful
- can do some DIY
Of course I can provide evidence for all of these things on request :)
