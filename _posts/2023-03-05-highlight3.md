# I worked as a bike designer

For a year and change I was a bike designer for Roetz Bikes, developing their [Life Cycle](https://www.roetz.life/en/). Being a fresh designer in a small company I wore many hats, such as:

- industrial designer (actually designing the bike).
- strategic designer (figuring out who would pay for the bike and why).
- electronics developer (creating a set of smart components that would report wear).
- programmer (making the smart things blink and throwing together a IoT server).
