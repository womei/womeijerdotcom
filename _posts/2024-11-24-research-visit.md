# I am looking for a research visit / internship in Spring 2025

Very quick info:
- Between April 2025 and September 2025
- I have my own funding for a research visit
- I am interested in expanding my research in 360Â° video (I have a secret project), looking more at Human Food Interaction, and / or looking at wargaming as a design tool.
- I will be done with my dissertation, but not yet be a doctor (Yay Dutch PhD timelines)
- I am a dual US / NL citizen (for working reasons)
