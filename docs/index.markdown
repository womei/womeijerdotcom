Welcome to my website! My name is Wo Meijer and I am a PhD candidate in Industrial Design at the TU Delft. My research focus is on video ethnography and human-food interaction, and I am dedicated to using my findings to design products and experiences that are intuitive and enjoyable for people. I am passionate about using design to make the world a better place, and I am excited to share my work and insights with you through this website.
