Welcome to my (work in progress) website! My name is Wo Meijer and I am a PhD candidate in Industrial Design at the TU Delft. My research focus is on video ethnography and human-food interaction, and I am dedicated to using my findings to design products and experiences that are intuitive and enjoyable for people. I am passionate about using design to make the world a better place, and I am excited to share my work and insights with you through this website.

## My PhD

I am currently a [PhD Candidate at the TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/personen/meijer-w), where I am primarily focused on using enhancing **video** as a design tool, you can find more info about that [here](./research/video.html).

If you're a masters student from IDE looking to do a graduation with me, I'm delighted! You can email me at `W.I.M.T.Meijer [at] tudelft.nl` to schedule a coffee chat.

## Side Dishes

Next to my main research I also work on:

- [human-food interaction](./research/food.html)
- [bad movies](gbbb.me)
- more random side projects than I can count...

If you are interested in those things, check them out, and feel free to send me an email at: `womeijer [at] gmail.com`

## The Before Times

Before my PhD I worked as a bike designer, co-founded a start up, and some other stuff, info [here](./work/exprience.html)
