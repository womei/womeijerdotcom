Before my PhD I worked as a bike designer, at a start-up, and had a few internships, you can read more about them and why they're cool here:

## Designer, Smart Connected Bicycles

Before beginning my PhD, I worked as a bike designer at Roetz Bikes specializing in the development of electronics and software for smart connected bikes designed to operate in B2B fleet operations. My goal was to create innovative products that not only improved the functionality of traditional bicycles, but also provided a more connected and enjoyable riding experience for users. As a designer, I was always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what was possible with bike technology, and I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work on some truly cutting-edge projects.

### Specific Responsibilities

- Staying up-to-date with industry developments and emerging technologies, and identifying opportunities for new product development.
- Prototyping a full smart bike system including features such as GPS tracking, predictive maintenance sensors, connectivity to smartphone apps, and automated fleet management.
- Developing and testing prototype bicycle components and electronics using Solidworks, Eagle, and my amazing prototyping/hacking skills.
- Working with manufacturers and suppliers to ensure that production processes meet quality and cost standards.

## Co-Founder, Electronics Designer

As a co-founder of Anything Connected, a start-up specializing in the development of IoT sensors for industrial clients. Our solution offers unparalleled design, fidelity, and flexibility. I was responsible for a variety of tasks related to prototyping and electronics design.

### Specific Responsibilities

- Collaborating with the rest of the Anything Connected team to identify and pursue new business opportunities with industrial clients.
- Developing and testing prototypes, and working with engineering teams to refine and optimize designs as needed.
- Managing the production process for new IoT sensor systems, including coordinating with manufacturers and suppliers to ensure that production meets quality and cost standards.
