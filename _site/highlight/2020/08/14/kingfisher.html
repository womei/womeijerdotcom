<p>Kingfishers are a family, the <strong>Alcedinidae</strong>, of small to medium-sized, brightly colored birds in the order <em>Coraciiformes</em>. They have a cosmopolitan distribution, with most species found in the tropical regions of <strong><em>Africa, Asia, and Oceania, but also can be seen in Europe</em></strong>. They can be found in deep forests near calm ponds and small rivers. The family contains 116 species and is divided into three subfamilies and 19 genera. All kingfishers have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most species have bright plumage with only small differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests.</p>

<p>They consume a wide range of prey usually caught by swooping down from a perch. While kingfishers are usually thought to live near rivers and eat fish, many species live away from water and eat small invertebrates. 
Like other members of their order, they nest in cavities, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. Some kingfishers nest in arboreal termite nests. A few species, principally insular forms, are threatened with extinction. In Britain, the word “kingfisher” normally refers to the common kingfisher.</p>

<h2 id="common-kingfisher">Common kingfisher</h2>

<p>The <strong>common kingfisher</strong> (<strong><em>Alcedo atthis</em></strong>), also known as the <strong>Eurasian kingfisher</strong> and <strong>river kingfisher</strong>, is a small kingfisher with seven subspecies recognized within its wide distribution across Eurasia and North Africa. It is resident in much of its range, but migrates from areas where rivers freeze in winter.</p>

<p>This sparrow-sized bird has the typical short-tailed, large-headed kingfisher profile; it has blue upperparts, orange underparts and a long bill. It feeds mainly on fish, caught by diving, and has special visual adaptations to enable it to see prey under water. The glossy white eggs are laid in a nest at the end of a burrow in a riverbank.</p>

<h3 id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h3>

<p>The common kingfisher was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Gracula atthis.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> The modern binomial name derives from the Latin alcedo, ‘kingfisher’ (from Greek ἀλκυών, halcyon), and Atthis, a beautiful young woman of Lesbos, and favourite of Sappho.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The genus Alcedo comprises seven small kingfishers that all eat fish as part of their diet. The common kingfisher’s closest relative is the cerulean kingfisher that has white underparts and is found in parts of Indonesia.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This species has the typical short-tailed, dumpy-bodied, large-headed, and long-billed kingfisher shape. The adult male of the western European subspecies, A. a. ispida has green-blue upperparts with pale azure-blue back and rump, a rufous patch by the bill base, and a rufous ear-patch. It has a green-blue neck stripe, white neck blaze and throat, rufous underparts, and a black bill with some red at the base. The legs and feet are bright red.[7] It is about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16 cm (6+1⁄2 in)</code> long with a wingspan of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">25 cm (10 in)</code>,[7] and weighs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">34–46 g (1+3⁄16–1+5⁄8 oz)</code>.[8] The female is identical in appearance to the male except that her lower mandible is orange-red with a black tip. The juvenile is similar to the adult, but with duller and greener upperparts and paler underparts. Its bill is black, and the legs are also initially black.[7] Feathers are moulted gradually between July and November with the main flight feathers taking 90–100 days to moult and regrow. Some that moult late may suspend their moult during cold winter weather.[citation needed]</p>

<h3 id="geographical-variation">Geographical variation</h3>
<p>There are seven subspecies differing in the hue of the upperparts and the intensity of the rufous colour of the underparts; size varies across the subspecies by up to 10%. The races resident south of the Wallace Line have the bluest upperparts and partly blue ear-patches.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>A. a. ispida</em> Linnaeus, 1758. Breeds from Ireland, Spain and southern Norway to Romania and western Russia and winters south to Iraq and southern Portugal.</li>
  <li><em>A. a. atthis</em>. Breeds from northwestern Africa and southern Italy east to Afghanistan, Kashmir region, northern Xinjiang, and Siberia; it is a winter visitor south to Israel,[10] northeastern Sudan, Yemen, Oman and Pakistan. Compared to A. a. ispida, it has a greener crown, paler underparts and is slightly larger.</li>
